Here we present the algorithm Sparse Semisupervised Heterogeneous Interbattery Bayessian Analysis along with the different modalitis in which it can be used. In particular, we included 6 different notebooks to develop the functioning of the algorithm.

The main goal is to explain the usage of the method as well as showing some results with different databases.

The multilabel database has to be downloaded from a different link.
